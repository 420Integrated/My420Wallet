## There's an Error When I Try to Swap

#### Refer to this list of common errors and solutions.

1. ‘Invalid Address’

   * MEW only supports 420coin-related crypto transactions.
   * If you’re swapping for a non-420coin asset, you will need to provide a non-420coin address from a different wallet.

2. ‘Not Checksummed’

   * <p>The checksum version of your address is the version that includes both capital and lowercase letters, for accuracy.</p>
     <strong>The address itself is not different.</strong>
   * You can find this version by searching your address on fourtwentyscan.420integrated.com.

3. ‘Out of Smoke’ or ‘Insufficient funds’

   * All transactions on the 420coin blockchain require 420coin for the fuel to make transactions happen, including swaps.
   * We recommend having at least .01 420coin to cover this cost.

4. Unintelligible Error / Other

   * Please reach out to us with as much information as possible.
